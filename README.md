# PlanCalculator

The plan calculator will take the purchase price and purchase date as input and output the deposit, installments amounts and dates. 

Customers can buy goods and pay the purchase price over time on a payment plan. 

Customers pay a deposit at the time of purchase, take the goods home and pay the remainder as instalments.

The required deposit and instalment interval and period depend on the purchase price, as shown below.
