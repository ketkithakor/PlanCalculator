# PlanCalculator - .Net Core 2.2 Console application

Customers can buy goods and pay the purchase price over time on a payment plan. 

Customers pay a deposit at the time of purchase, take the goods home and pay the remainder as instalments.

The required deposit and instalment interval and period depend on the purchase price, as shown below.
